    "story": "This is a good recipe to cook for a big family gathering. Bolognese sauce tastes the same after defrosting, so I usually make twice bigger bowl and freeze it for super quick future dinners.<br /><br />In this photo pasta is seasoned with grated cheddar, although I prefer Parmigiano instead.",
